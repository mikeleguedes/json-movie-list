  "storyline": "For television presenter Lisa Wartberg her job is the most important thing in life. That changes, however, when her mother Maria loses her memory after an accident and suddenly knows only one thing: she has never been to New York. The feisty lady escapes from the hospital and smuggles herself as a stowaway on board a cruise ship to finally experience the city, which never sleeps, up close. Her daughter has no choice but to go on the search for her mother together with her make-up artist Fred. They do find her, but the ship leaves before Lisa and her mother get off board. A chaotic journey across the Atlantic begins, where Lisa not only gets to know passenger Axel and his son, but also her mother makes an exciting acquaintance."
