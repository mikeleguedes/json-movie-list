  "storyline": "In rural Virginia in the mid-1920s, young boy Desmond Doss nearly kills his younger brother Hal while they play. Because of this event and his Adventist education, Doss's belief in the commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is reinforced. Years later, as an adult, Doss takes an injured man on the street to the hospital and meets Nurse Dorothy Schutte. The two start a romance and Doss tells Dorothy about his interest in medical work."
